This package is working, but still a lot has to change.


** TODO **

CurlOO:

Easy:
- review !
+ delay deaths
- test callback arguments just before perform (maybe only for default writers)
- implement pause (curl_easy_pause)
- implement reset (curl_easy_reset)
+ allow calling strerror as function
+ write some documentation
- write more documentation
- multiple options in setopt

Form:
- test with Easy
- implement buffer options
- implement read callback
+ write some documentation
- write more documentation

Multi:
- remove all remaining easy handles when destroying multi
- implement list_handles(), will be very easy since we need to store them
  for above problem
- implement assign (curl_multi_assign)
+ remove remove_handle from info_read
+ allow calling strerror as function
+ write some documentation
- write more documentation

Share:
- test with Easy
+ allow calling strerror as function
+ write some documentation

tests:
- use some pure-perl http server, should do for most tests
- review and renumerate
- add more crash tests (remove last reference while performing,
  forced destrution, etc)
